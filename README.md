## What the hell is this?
- This is a wrapper for the barq api.
- It includes the wrapper, an account manager, gemini wrapper, json database wrapper, bert interactions, and more
## Why?
- Was for fun. was for practice. it got to be too large and i dont have time for this so im going to work on other stuff
- someone else might be able to use it so i decided to publish it
## You should know...
- i tried to include what would be useful
- there are python examples that show scraping data, interacting with people using gemini
- there is no support, warranty, or license
- barq uses graphql and you can get full profile information in batches of 100 (wtf??)
